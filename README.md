Re-learning GIT the right way

# A bit about me
I guess I want to be a real computer programmer, but so far, in the past 25 years or so of me writing programs,
I feel like I haven't really done it. 

I have dabbled in the beginning with LOGO (when I was about 6 or 7), and we made various shapes by writing commands such as FD 100, RT 45 etc... 

I do remember seeing some kids being able to write Loops and make awesome shapes, but nobody ever bothered telling me what was going on.

I later discovered GW-BASIC and learned some more programming constructs. I especially enjoyed GOTO's and IF ELSE's. 
That was when I was 10.

I also figured out on my own how to create animations. I posited that if I could draw say a circle again and again using a GOTO statement, and every time altering its position just a bit, it'd drop like an animation.

When I did that... all I got what a series of balls drawn in no time. I immediately realized, I needed to clear the screen every time... and I did that.

But nothing happened. I then realized, probably just as immediately that it was going way too fast. And I had to dig up the delay command from my GW-BASIC book. When I finally found that command, I must have spent at least 3 to 4 months enjoying making my 'games'.

I also later on discovered the PLAY function and that is when my pleasures of playing the Piano coincided with my pleasure to make music on the computer!

# Visual Basic
A few years later, I had win 3.10 on my 486 and I began enjoying the GUI interface a lot. 
I learned every feature that was available in MS OFFICE and began wondering how those programs were written. 

Till I encountered Visual Basic. And that is when event-driven programming, Windows System DLL (Dynamic Linked Libraries) and Animations became my foray.
